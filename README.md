# Lab 5 - Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression #

For this lab, you have been provided with 5 data files via pickle.  The data are
arranged such that the first two columns are the features (A1C and weight) and
the third column is whether or not the patient is diabetic.

For each dataset, you will:

1. Use the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier to classify the diabetic and non-diabetic
   patients
2. Use the Logistic Regression classifier to clasify the diabetic and
   non-diabetic patients
3. Plot the ROC curve for each of the above
4. Calculate the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1 score, and AUC for each
   of the above

Again, you are not being given a specific starting point.  However, you should
be creating a markdown file (results.md) that clearly labels the dataset and
displays the various metrics, and the ROC curve as an embedded figure.
